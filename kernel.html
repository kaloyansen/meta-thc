 id="x1-4001"></a><a 
href="#cite.0@love2010">2</a>] is a critical component of an OS responsible for low-level resource
            management and communication with HW. Famous examples are NT (New
            Technology) kernel designed by Microsoft Corporation and XNU (X is Not Unix).
            The last one is an Unix-like kernel from Apple Inc.

               <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-50002.2"></a>multitasking</h4>
            <!--l. 62--><p class="noindent" >Multitasking is about running processes. It is important to understand that a single
            processor may run only one process at a time. Even on multiprocessor platforms, the
            number of processes exceeds the number of processors by at least two to three orders
            of magnitude. Fortunately, most OSes are able to interleave execution of multiple
            processes.
            <!--l. 69--><p class="indent" >     In <span 
class="cmmi-10">cooperative multitasking</span>, a process does not stop running before it has
            decided itself, in example, when the task is completed. I wonder why it is called like
            that because there is nothing <span 
class="cmmi-10">cooperative </span>here. In this approach, a single process
            could monopolize the machine processor time and potentially bring the entire OS
            down.
            <!--l. 76--><p class="indent" >     Fortunately, modern OSes employ another solution. In this approach, called
            <span 
class="cmmi-10">preemptive multitasking</span>, the kernel grants processes tiny pieces of processor time
            called <span 
class="cmmi-10">time</span>-<span 
class="cmmi-10">slices</span>. Their duration is calculated by dedicated algorithms. When a
            time-slice is over, the kernel interrupts the corresponding process in a task called
            <span 
class="cmmi-10">preemption</span>, saving the entire working context in order to resume this process later,
            when the next time-slice will be granted to it. With a typical time-slice length on the
            order of <span 
class="cmmi-10">milliseconds</span>, the preemption gives human beings the attractive illusion
            of many processes running simultaneously. Unfortunately this is not the
            case.
            <!--l. 87--><p class="indent" >     Symmetrical multiprocessor (SMP) support is a common HW feature supported
            by the modern OSes. It allows for more efficient management and usage of multiple
            processors. This is achieved by considering all processors identical. In addition, they
            may share HW resources like memory and various devices between them. The
            purpose of SMP support is to ensure that multiple processors work together in
            harmony to deliver improved performance.
            <!--l. 95--><p class="noindent" >
               <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-60002.3"></a>kernel modules</h4>
            <!--l. 96--><p class="noindent" >Linux supports dynamic insertion and removal of code at runtime. This code is
            grouped in loadable binary objects called modules. Module support allows OSes to
            have a compact base kernel image without missing optional features and drivers
            supplied via modules.
            <!--l. 102--><p class="indent" >     A device driver, in example, could be compiled as a part of the kernel or
            separately - as a kernel module. This depends on the kernel build configuration. As a
            part of the kernel, the driver is loaded on boot and unloaded on shut down. As a
            module it could be loaded or unloaded anytime the system may need so. The last
            solution decreases kernel size and Linux boot time but may potentially decrease OS
            performance.

            <!--l. 113--><p class="noindent" >The initial version of Unix was created in Bell Labs in 1969. The design principles
            like hierarchical file system, command-line interface and multi-user support
            have been followed in many modern OSes. However, it was a commercial
            product with a proprietary development model and practically no development
            community.
            <!--l. 120--><p class="indent" >     Linux is an OS kernel that was originally developed by Linus Torvalds twenty
            years later in 1991. In short, it is an Unix-like kernel, but it has a source code freely
            available to the public. Linux is used as a kernel in multiple OSes, commonly referred
            to as GNU/Linux distributions.
            <!--l. 126--><p class="indent" >     There are two families of OS kernels - monolithic and micro-kernels. Micro-kernels
            run as multiple processes usually called servers. As a monolithic kernel, Linux is
            designed to run as a single piece of SW in a special part of the memory called
            kernel-space.
            <!--l. 131--><p class="indent" >     In contrast, applications run a virtual environment, provided by Linux, called
            user-space. The kernel makes each application feel like it has all available resources
            while, in fact, it shares with the other applications and it has exactly as memory and
            processor time as Linux has granted. This control makes the main difference with
            older Unix kernels.
            <!--l. 138--><p class="indent" >     If Linux differs from classic Unix systems, the reason is that Linus Torvalds and
            his community behind the kernel were willing and able to chose the best solution for
            any problem. In addition, they have invented new approaches when they were not
            happy with existing. Readers may find the most important characteristics of the
